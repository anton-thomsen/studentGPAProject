## Student Exams Grading

## Description:
I was asked to make a student grading program where all the exam scores are calculated together and given a grade based on how well they preformed. This was mainly a project to learn the if-else-if-else statements and thats why I wasn't using the static instead. 

## Process:
I actually misunderstood the assignment a little where I thought that I needed to do this project totally on my own but aperantly it was guided with step by step but I think I learned alot more doing it my self even though it took longer and it gave me more headache. I didn't do it totally on my own as some concepts I was unsure of how to execute proporly. I wrote the code as good as I could from the start which made me really need to think how to try to do it on my own then I had help from Gemini to correct some mistakes or to help me think in a different way. I actually think this method was great for learning and I'll probably follow this method for future projects as I think it's a better way of ingaging my brain in trying to find solutions to the tasks.

## Difficulty:
Well because I did alot of it on my own it was actually very hard trying to figure out how to do certain stuff and I actually wrote one way of the code where I did the foreach for every single student which I then had to delete because I could just assign the scores to the student name and then make the foreach go once instead of having a loop for every single student.
